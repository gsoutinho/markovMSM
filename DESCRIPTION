Title: Methods for checking the Markov condition in multi-state survival data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Gustavo Soutinho and Luis Meira-Machado.

Description: The inference in multi-state models is traditionally performed under a Markov
             assumption that claims that past and future of the process are independent given
             the present state. In this package, we present the Area under the curve (AUC) method 
             as a local and global test for checking the Markov assumption.
