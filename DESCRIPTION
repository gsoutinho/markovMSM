Description: The inference in multi-state models is traditionally performed under a Markov
             assumption that claims that past and future of the process are independent given
             the present state. In this package, we consider tests of the Markov assumption that 
             are applicable to general multi-state models. Three approaches
             using existing methodology are considered: a simple method based on including
             covariates depending on the history in Cox models for the transition intensities; methods
             based on measuring the discrepancy of the non-Markov estimators of the transition probabilities
             to the Markovian Aalen-Johansen estimators; and, finally, methods that were
             developed by considering summaries from families of log-rank statistics where patients
             are grouped by the state occupied of the process at a particular time point.
