# markovMSM: An R package for checking the Markov condition in multi-state survival data


  ```markovMSM``` is an R package which considers tests of the Markov assumption 
that are applicable to general multi-state models. Three approaches using existing
methodology are considered: a simple method based on including
covariates depending on the history in Cox models for the transition intensities; methods
based on measuring the discrepancy of the non-Markov estimators of the transition probabilities
to the Markovian Aalen-Johansen estimators; and, finally, methods that were
developed by considering summaries from families of log-rank statistics where patients
are grouped by the state occupied of the process at a particular time point.
